Libguides v2
============

Style codebase for LibGuides v2 - Includes only the minimal changes to match style standards.

In the various LibApps, you can find text inputs under 'Admin/Look and Feel', which allow you to modify the header, footer, and add any custom css/js. The files in this repository directly correspond to those fields, and you should update the files in this repository when you make any changes to the live code.

There is only one file for header.html and footer.html for both LibGuides and LibAnswers because the header and footer on both systems should be identical.

custom.html refers to the codebase to be used in LibGuides' [custom] field, while libAnswers-custom.html corresponds to the [custom] field from LibAnswers.

TODO: add a custom css to document changes for LibChat
TODO: create a direct link between the LibApps and the files in this repository so you only need to update this repository for the changes to appear.
